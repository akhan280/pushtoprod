# Domains API

This code snippet shows you how you can leverage Vercel's Domains API to add and remove domains programmatically from your Platforms on Vercel project.

## Dependencies

- Tailwind CSS (`npm install tailwindcss`)
- SWR (`npm install swr`)
- React Hot Toast (`npm install react-hot-toast`) (optional)
- JS Cookie (`npm install js-cookie`) (optional)

## Demo

## Features

### 1. Adding Domains

To add a domain, you can use the `/v8/projects/{idOrName}/domains` endpoint as shown [here](./pages/api/add-domain.js) ([full documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#endpoints/projects/add-a-domain-to-a-project)).

When a domain is added, there are 3 possible outcomes:

1. Domain is added successfully (response code `200`).
2. Domains is already in use by another project and can't be added (response code `409`).
3. Domains belongs to a different team but you can potentially request delegation for the domain (response code `403`).

#### Request Delegation of Domains

Requesting delegation of domains can be done with the `/v6/domains/{domain}/request-delegation` endpoint as shown [here](./pages/api/request-delegation.js) ([full documentation](https://vercel.notion.site/Preview-Requesting-Subdomain-Access-79df63d854b24a0abd52da991d50cb81)).

Below is an example of how to the request delegation flow is like for the end user:

1. User runs into an error where a domain is already owned by a different team.

2. User clicks on "Click here to request access" and receives a success toast notifiying that their request was successfully sent.

3. When the user tries to add the domain again, it should get added automatically.

### 2. Auto-checking Domain Configuration

When a domain is first added to a project, we use [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) to periodically check if the domain's DNS records are configured correctly. This is done using the `/v6/domains/{domain}/config` endpoint as shown [here](./pages/api/check-domain.js).

There are two ways that your users can configure their domains after they are added:

- CNAME record:
  - recommended for subdomains (blog.domain.com, app.domain.com)
  - you can set up a branded CNAME value by adding an `A` record for the `cname` subdomain on your domain and point it to to Vercel's IP address `76.76.21.21`
- A record:
  - recommended for apex domains (domain.com)

### 3. Removing Domains

To remove a domain, you can use the `/v8/projects/{idOrName}/domains` endpoint as shown [here](./pages/api/remove-domain.js) ([full documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#endpoints/projects/remove-a-domain-from-a-project)).
