**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**, or DAOs for short, are self-governing organizations that enable groups of like-minded individuals to work towards a mutual goal.

Think [subreddits](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/subreddit/), but:

- Instead of clicking "Join" to join a subreddit, you have to own a DAO's token to be a part of it.
- Instead of having a moderator to make sure all the content is appropriate, a DAO self-governs through a pre-determined set of principles/rules.
- Instead of upvoting/downvoting posts, each DAO member has voting rights that allow them to make governance decisions for the DAO. These voting rights are proportionate to the number of the DAO's tokens that they own.
- Instead of transacting in Reddit Gold, which is controlled by Reddit and can be shut down at any time, DAOs transact via the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and censorship-resistant.

In other words, DAOs are a safe and efficient way for complete strangers to work together over the internet without having to worry that one of them is going to go rogue and run away with the money.

There is no hierarchy, red tape, or any of the bureaucratic BS that plague traditional organizations. Everything is done on-chain, which provides complete transparency and reduces the chances of corruption.

## Governance Structure in DAOs

Unlike traditional organizations, where hierarchy matters, DAOs generally have a flat structure.

When a new idea is proposed in traditional organizations, it usually requires approval by someone from the "managerial" or "executive" layers before it can be implemented.

In DAOs:

- Proposed ideas are voted on by everyone in the DAO in a fully-transparent manner using tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), which is powered by IFPS + the Ethereum blockchain.
- Any discussions prior to voting take place on platforms like Discourse (e.g. [Uniswap's Governance Discourse](https://gov.uniswap.org/)), which is fully open-source and customizable.
- For a full-suite DAO governance & management experience, DAOs also use tools like [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/), which gives a 30,000 foot view of their DAO's operations.

This method of governance is inspired by the concept of "[holocracy](https://www.holacracy.org/)", which encourages autonomy and ownership over bureaucracy and hierarchy.

## Types of DAOs

There are several types of DAOs in today's market:

- Investment DAOs
- Protocol DAOs
- Service DAOs
- Project DAOs
- Community DAOs

### Investment DAOs

Imagine raising $50M in 3 days from thousands to [purchase an original copy of the U.S. constitution](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/crypto-constitution-sothebys.html). While not all of them are that flamboyant, investment DAOs allow users to pool together large sums of money and make investments in projects that align with their manifesto (e.g.: [Klima DAO's manifesto](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima.fi-manifesto)).

These DAOs are usually mission-driven and have a large following behind them. Some prominent examples include the aforementioned [Constitution DAO](/dao/constitution), the decentralized investing protocol [Syndicate DAO](/dao/syndicate) and the climate-change driven [Klima DAO](/dao/klima).

<DaoExamples slugs=[constitution,syndicate,klima] />

### Protocol DAOs

Think money, but programmable. Protocol DAOs introduced the concept of transferrable [ERC20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) tokens that power all sorts of transactions in the secondary market. DAO members are able to vote on proposals to change the underlying mechanisms of the protocol itself.

Uniswap, for instance, has a [list of proposals on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap) for token holders to vote and provide feedback on. Once a consensus has been reached, the proposal is then accepted and implemented.

### Service DAOs

[The world needs talent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/04/17/a-war-for-talent-is-starting-spoiler-alert-workers-will-win/), now more than ever. Service DAOs are talent aggregators, where professionals of the same field come together and form an on-chain alliance to provide their services as a collective whole.

From software development ([Developer DAO](/dao/developer)) to design ([Vector DAO](/dao/vector)) to legal services ([Lex DAO](/dao/lex)), service DAOs provide a way for companies to hire talent in web3.

### Project DAOs

Similar to service DAOs, project DAOs are individuals united to build projects/products to achieve a certain goal. Revenue generated by these products is then funneled back into a treasury governed by the DAO's token holders.

Some notable examples:

- [Badger DAO](/dao/badger): built a [suite of products](https://badger.com/products) that make it easy for users to earn yield on their Bitcoin through a DeFi bridge
- [Index Coop](/dao/indexcoop): built products like the [Defi Pulse Index](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi), which gives investors a safer, capitalization-weighted index to invest in the DeFi market
- [Seed Club](/dao/seedclub): released products like [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/), a way for people to pool together funds to purchase NFTs as a team

<DaoExamples slugs=[badger,indexcoop,seedclub] />

### Community DAOs

Humans are social animals. We naturally gravitate toward like-minded people and form social groups around a common topic.

Community DAOs exist to give these groups of people a space to interact and have discussions – similar to good ol' Reddit. For members of community DAOs, financial returns are not as important as community-exclusive perks such as early access to latest releases, member-only meetups, etc.

Some examples include – [Friends With Benefits](/dao/fwb), [Pleasr DAO](/dao/pleasr), and [Orange DAO](/dao/orange) (DAO of YC Alumni).

## DAOs = Future of Work

DAOs have grown a lot in popularity in recent years, thanks to the rise of Web3 and the rising desire for operational transparency and autonomy in today's workforce.

While there are still certain limitations when it comes to running a DAO (e.g. over-abundance in autonomy leading to a never-ending decision-making process), DAOs are still in their infant stage.

As we see more innovation in the DAO tooling space (e.g. [Zenefits for DAOs](https://utopialabs.com/)), DAOs will continue to evolve and mature. And who knows, maybe one day, instead of registering an LLC/C Corp in Delaware, we'll be registering a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain instead.
