Today, I have some very exciting news to share with all of you.

**DAO Jones is rebranding to DAO Central**. Along with our new name, we also have a new vision — to become the Product Hunt for [DAOs](/blog/what-is-a-dao).

## How It All Started

DAO Jones started with a simple question that I asked my [roommate](https://twitter.com/abishekdharshan) two Fridays ago:

> What if there was a way for us to search for a DAO by the emojis that we see in a Twitter bio?

I've always been very intrigued by the Web3 space, and this seemed like the perfect excuse to spend some time learning more about the space...by building a side project.

I set a goal to build this over the weekend (48 hours) – partly to see how fast I can come up with an MVP, but also because I had to work on Monday.

Due to the time constraint, I decided not to waste too much time on naming. In the beginning, I was debating between **_Just DAO It_** and **_DAO It Yourself_**, but I eventually settled on this quirky, punny name that came to me when I was on a walk – **_DAO Jones_**.

Two very intense days of coding later, I launched DAO Jones on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1463554409242062849?=20

The reception was incredible – my tweets got over 200K impressions, which resulted in 4.2K unique visitors, 150+ signups, and a ton of new DAOs added to the site.

I couldn't have asked for a better launch.

## Why Rebrand

As my tweets started to make the rounds on Twitter, it also caught the eye of a few folks who were quick to point out that the name **_DAO Jones_** was already being used by two other organizations in the DAO/Web3 space.

With that in mind, I spent some time during Thanksgiving thinking about branding and realized that while **_DAO Jones_** was a very clever name, there were a few clear disadvantages:

1. It wasn't a unique name that I could build proper brand equity on top of since I'll have to compete with two other companies with the same name in this space.
2. I didn't own the .COM or the Twitter handle.
3. I might run into legal issues with _the actual Dow Jones_ down the road.

I also got a clearer picture of the vision for the project – to be the Product Hunt for DAOs. On one hand, DAO organizers can use it as a platform to share their DAOs and get some initial traction on it, and on the other, end-users can go there to discover new DAOs to join.

**_DAO Jones_** wouldn't be a very fitting name for this new vision since it's more of an inside joke than an actual company name.

And this is when I came across the name **_DAO Central_** (h/t to [Bani](https://twitter.com/banisgh) for the suggestion).

To my surprise, both **daocentral.com** and the Twitter handle [@DAOCentral](https://twitter.com/DAOCentral) were available (the .COM cost me $700, though).

One fairly expensive domain purchase later, I was the proud owner of the domain **daocentral.com**.

## Conclusion

**DAO Jones is now DAO Central.**

Our name might've changed, but our mission stays the same – to educate as many people as possible about DAOs and to help DAOs find the best people to join their communities.

On that note, I just wrote a [blog post](/blog/what-is-a-dao) that serves as an ELI5 intro for people who want to learn more about DAOs – feel free to give it a read!
