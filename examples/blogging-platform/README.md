# Blogging Platform

A blogging platform that allows users to create blogs with a default subdomain and the option to add a custom domain (usually with a premium monthly subscription).

### Demo

For context, here's a starter kit of a blogging platform built on Vercel:

- [demo.vercel.pub](https://demo.vercel.pub)
- [platformize.co](https://platformize.co) (custom domain that maps to [demo.vercel.pub](https://demo.vercel.pub))
- [app.vercel.pub](https://app.vercel.pub) (editing backend)

All of these generated sites are powered by ISR (no SSR at all) so they load pretty much instantly + the inter-page transitions are lightning fast.

### Features

- Multitenancy (subdomains + custom domains) with Vercel Domains API
- Static generation with ISR
- Static tweets (supports image, video, gif, poll, retweets, quote retweets, etc.)
- Uploading custom images (with a Cloudinary integration)
- Empty states
- Error states (for adding custom domains + subdomains)
- Fallback states for ISR on the frontend
